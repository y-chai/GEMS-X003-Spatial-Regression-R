# Spatial Regression in R

Welcome to **GEMS X003.4 Explicitly Accounting for Location in Agriculture: Spatial Regression in R**.

This course is designed for those who want to learn spatial regression techniques and model spatial dependency explicitly. Through this course, you will learn about spatial dependency and spatial autocorrelation, the construction of spatial weight matrices, testing for spatial association and correlation and building generalized spatial regression models. You will have the opportunity to immediately practice your new skills via hands-on exercises focused on agri-food applications throughout the 2.5-hour workshop.

This workshop is part of a series on working with and analyzing spatial agricultural data in R.
